# PageRank-Algorithm-by-Scratch

# Task

1. Implement the PageRank Algorithm as discussed in Section 5.1 and 5.2 (Leskovec, Rajaraman and Ullman) in JAVA, Python or C++. Your im- plementation should make use of the improvements regarding eciency and the methods of dealing with dead-ends and spider traps. There are several PageRank implementations available on the web. You have to do your own implementation without using any code from other sources.

2. Run your algorithm on the Google Web Graph 2002 available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.html and provide a le listing the PageRank for each node. Report separately, the ordered list of the ten nodes having the largest PageRank Your approach should be ecient as possible in terms of runtime and memory requirements.

<B>Note: you are asked to implement the algorithm from scratch, without using third party implementations/ libraries.</B>
